To replace the mock EnOSMapper implementation with the real one:

1. Edit file: backend/app/api/routes.py

2. Find the mock implementation section starting around line 65:
   # For debugging - create a simplified response without using actual mapper

3. Replace that section with the real EnOSMapper implementation described in the next line

4. Save the file and restart the server

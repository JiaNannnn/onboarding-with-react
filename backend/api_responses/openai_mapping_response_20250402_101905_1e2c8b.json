  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in mapping Building Management System (BMS) points to EnOS schema points.\n\nDevice Point Context:\n- Device Type: \n- Device ID: \n- Point Name: WTS1.TDS\n- Point Type: analog-input\n- Unit: no-units\n- Value Example: N/A\n- Related points in same device: PH, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance\n\nTask: Map this BMS point to the corresponding EnOS point name.\nThe EnOS point name should follow the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\n\nExamples:\n- Chiller supply temperature → CH_raw_temp_chws\n- AHU return temperature → AHU_raw_temp_rt\n- Fan power measurement → FCU_raw_power_fan\n\nProvide:\n1. EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "To map the BMS point \"WTS1.TDS\" to the EnOS schema, we need to understand the context and the nature of the point. However, the provided information is limited, and some assumptions will be necessary.\n\n1. **EnOS Point Name**: Since the point name is \"WTS1.TDS\" and it is an analog input with no units, it suggests a measurement related to water treatment or a similar system. \"TDS\" typically stands for Total Dissolved Solids, which is a common measurement in water systems. Assuming \"WTS\" stands for Water Treatment System, the EnOS point name could be:\n\n   **WTS_raw_tds**\n\n2. **Confidence Score**: 0.7\n\n3. **Brief Explanation of Mapping**: \n   - **Device Type Category**: \"WTS\" is assumed to be Water Treatment System based on the point name and typical industry abbreviations.\n   - **Measurement Type**: \"TDS\" is a common measurement in water systems, indicating Total Dissolved Solids.\n   - **Point Type**: Since it's an analog input with no specific unit, it aligns with a raw measurement type.\n   - The confidence score is 0.7 due to the lack of explicit information about the device type and the exact nature of the measurement. The mapping is based on common industry terminology and the context provided.",

EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: FCU_raw_energy_yearly\n2. Confidence score: 0.9\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: The BMS point \"FCUEnergy.Yearly-KtRh\" is related to energy measurement over a yearly period for a Fan Coil Unit (FCU). In the EnOS schema, the device type \"FCUEnergy\" is mapped to \"FCU\" as the device type category. The measurement type is \"energy,\" and the point is specifically for \"yearly\" data. The format follows the pattern of DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT, resulting in \"FCU_raw_energy_yearly.\" The confidence score is 0.9 due to the lack of a specific unit, which suggests a potential for alternative interpretations.",

  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in mapping Building Management System (BMS) points to EnOS schema points.\n\nDevice Point Context:\n- Device Type: \n- Device ID: \n- Point Name: CH-2.HeatBalance\n- Point Type: analog-input\n- Unit: no-units\n- Value Example: N/A\n- Related points in same device: PH, TDS, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance\n\nTask: Map this BMS point to the corresponding EnOS point name.\nThe EnOS point name should follow the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\n\nExamples:\n- Chiller supply temperature → CH_raw_temp_chws\n- AHU return temperature → AHU_raw_temp_rt\n- Fan power measurement → FCU_raw_power_fan\n\nProvide:\n1. EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: CH_raw_heatbalance_hb\n2. Confidence score: 0.8\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: \n\nThe point name \"CH-2.HeatBalance\" suggests that it is related to a chiller (CH), specifically focusing on a heat balance measurement. In the EnOS schema, the format requires specifying the device type category, the measurement type, and the specific point. Given the examples, \"CH\" is used for chillers, and \"heatbalance\" is the measurement type. Since \"HeatBalance\" is repeated multiple times in the related points, it indicates that this is a key measurement for this device. The suffix \"hb\" is used to denote \"heat balance\" as the specific point. The confidence score is 0.8 due to the lack of additional context about the specific role or calculation method of the heat balance in this device, which could affect the exact naming convention.",

  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in mapping Building Management System (BMS) points to EnOS schema points.\n\nDevice Point Context:\n- Device Type: \n- Device ID: \n- Point Name: WTS1.PH\n- Point Type: analog-input\n- Unit: no-units\n- Value Example: N/A\n- Related points in same device: TDS, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance\n\nTask: Map this BMS point to the corresponding EnOS point name.\nThe EnOS point name should follow the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\n\nExamples:\n- Chiller supply temperature → CH_raw_temp_chws\n- AHU return temperature → AHU_raw_temp_rt\n- Fan power measurement → FCU_raw_power_fan\n\nProvide:\n1. EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "To map the BMS point \"WTS1.PH\" to the EnOS schema, we need to understand the context and the naming conventions used in the examples provided. However, the given information is limited, and some assumptions will be made based on typical BMS and EnOS naming conventions.\n\n1. **EnOS Point Name**: WTS_raw_ph\n2. **Confidence Score**: 0.7\n3. **Explanation of Mapping**:\n   - **Device Type Category**: The device type is not explicitly provided, but \"WTS\" could potentially stand for \"Water Treatment System\" or a similar system. Therefore, I used \"WTS\" as the device type category.\n   - **Measurement Type**: The point name \"PH\" suggests that this is a pH measurement. In the context of water systems, pH is a common parameter measured.\n   - **Point**: The point type is \"analog-input,\" which aligns with the measurement of pH as an analog value.\n   - **Format**: Following the format DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT, the EnOS point name is constructed as \"WTS_raw_ph\".\n\nGiven the lack of specific information about the device type and the exact nature of the point, the confidence score is set at 0.7. Additional context about the device type and its function would help refine this mapping.",

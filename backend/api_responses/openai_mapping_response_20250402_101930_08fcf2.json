  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in mapping Building Management System (BMS) points to EnOS schema points.\n\nDevice Point Context:\n- Device Type: AHUEnergy\n- Device ID: \n- Point Name: AHUEnergy.Daily-kWh\n- Point Type: analog-input\n- Unit: no-units\n- Value Example: N/A\n- Related points in same device: Ahu-kW, Ahu-Ton, Monthly-kWh, Quarterly-MWh, Yearly-MWh, Daily-tRh, Monthly-tRh, Quarterly-KtRh, Yearly-KtRh, Daily-Efficiency, Monthly-Efficiency, Quarterly-Efficiency, Yearly-Efficiency\n\nTask: Map this BMS point to the corresponding EnOS point name.\nThe EnOS point name should follow the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\n\nExamples:\n- Chiller supply temperature → CH_raw_temp_chws\n- AHU return temperature → AHU_raw_temp_rt\n- Fan power measurement → FCU_raw_power_fan\n\nProvide:\n1. EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: AHU_raw_energy_dailykwh\n2. Confidence score: 0.9\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: The BMS point \"AHUEnergy.Daily-kWh\" represents the daily energy consumption of an Air Handling Unit (AHU). In the EnOS schema, the point name is constructed by combining the device type category (AHU), the measurement type (energy), and the specific point (dailykwh). The prefix \"raw\" indicates that this is a direct measurement from the device. The format follows the examples provided, ensuring consistency in naming conventions. The confidence score is 0.9 due to the straightforward nature of the mapping, though the lack of a unit in the BMS point introduces slight uncertainty.",

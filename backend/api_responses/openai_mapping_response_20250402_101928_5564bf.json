  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in mapping Building Management System (BMS) points to EnOS schema points.\n\nDevice Point Context:\n- Device Type: AHUEnergy\n- Device ID: \n- Point Name: AHUEnergy.Ahu-Ton\n- Point Type: analog-input\n- Unit: no-units\n- Value Example: N/A\n- Related points in same device: Ahu-kW, Daily-kWh, Monthly-kWh, Quarterly-MWh, Yearly-MWh, Daily-tRh, Monthly-tRh, Quarterly-KtRh, Yearly-KtRh, Daily-Efficiency, Monthly-Efficiency, Quarterly-Efficiency, Yearly-Efficiency\n\nTask: Map this BMS point to the corresponding EnOS point name.\nThe EnOS point name should follow the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\n\nExamples:\n- Chiller supply temperature → CH_raw_temp_chws\n- AHU return temperature → AHU_raw_temp_rt\n- Fan power measurement → FCU_raw_power_fan\n\nProvide:\n1. EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: AHU_raw_energy_ton\n2. Confidence score: 0.9\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: The BMS point \"AHUEnergy.Ahu-Ton\" is associated with an Air Handling Unit (AHU) and represents a measurement related to energy, specifically in tons. Following the EnOS naming convention, the point name is constructed by identifying the device type category (AHU), the measurement type (energy), and the specific point (ton). The prefix \"raw\" is used to indicate that this is a direct measurement from the device. The confidence score is high because the mapping aligns well with the provided examples and the context of the device and point name.",

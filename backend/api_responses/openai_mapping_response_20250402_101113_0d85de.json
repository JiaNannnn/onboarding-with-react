  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in mapping Building Management System (BMS) points to EnOS schema points.\n\nDevice Point Context:\n- Device Type: AHUEnergy\n- Device ID: \n- Point Name: AHUEnergy.Monthly-kWh\n- Point Type: analog-input\n- Unit: no-units\n- Value Example: N/A\n- Related points in same device: Ahu-kW, Ahu-Ton, Daily-kWh, Quarterly-MWh, Yearly-MWh, Daily-tRh, Monthly-tRh, Quarterly-KtRh, Yearly-KtRh, Daily-Efficiency, Monthly-Efficiency, Quarterly-Efficiency, Yearly-Efficiency\n\nTask: Map this BMS point to the corresponding EnOS point name.\nThe EnOS point name should follow the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\n\nExamples:\n- Chiller supply temperature → CH_raw_temp_chws\n- AHU return temperature → AHU_raw_temp_rt\n- Fan power measurement → FCU_raw_power_fan\n\nProvide:\n1. EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: AHU_raw_energy_monthly\n2. Confidence score: 0.9\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: \n\nThe BMS point \"AHUEnergy.Monthly-kWh\" represents the monthly energy consumption of an Air Handling Unit (AHU). In the EnOS schema, the point name is constructed using the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT. Here, \"AHU\" is the device type category, \"raw\" indicates that this is a direct measurement without any processing or transformation, \"energy\" is the measurement type reflecting the energy consumption, and \"monthly\" specifies the time period of the measurement. The confidence score is 0.9 because the mapping follows the provided format and examples closely, but there is a slight uncertainty due to the absence of a unit in the BMS point, which is typically expected for energy measurements.",

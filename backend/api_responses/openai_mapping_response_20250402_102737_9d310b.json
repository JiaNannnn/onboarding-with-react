  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in mapping Building Management System (BMS) points to EnOS schema points.\n\nDevice Point Context:\n- Device Type: \n- Device ID: \n- Point Name: CH-1.HeatBalance\n- Point Type: analog-input\n- Unit: no-units\n- Value Example: N/A\n- Related points in same device: PH, TDS, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance\n\nTask: Map this BMS point to the corresponding EnOS point name.\nThe EnOS point name should follow the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\n\nExamples:\n- Chiller supply temperature → CH_raw_temp_chws\n- AHU return temperature → AHU_raw_temp_rt\n- Fan power measurement → FCU_raw_power_fan\n\nProvide:\n1. EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: CH_raw_energy_heatbalance\n2. Confidence score: 0.8\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: \n\nThe point name \"CH-1.HeatBalance\" suggests that it is related to a chiller (CH) and involves some form of energy or heat measurement. In the EnOS schema, \"CH\" is used to denote chiller-related points. The term \"HeatBalance\" typically refers to an energy balance or calculation related to heat, which aligns with the \"energy\" measurement type in EnOS. The point type \"analog-input\" indicates that it is a raw measurement, which is consistent with the \"raw\" prefix in the EnOS point name. Given these considerations, the EnOS point name \"CH_raw_energy_heatbalance\" is a suitable mapping. The confidence score of 0.8 reflects some uncertainty due to the lack of specific unit information and the repetition of \"HeatBalance\" in related points, which might indicate different contexts or calculations.",

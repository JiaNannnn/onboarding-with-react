  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in mapping Building Management System (BMS) points to EnOS schema points.\n\nDevice Point Context:\n- Device Type: \n- Device ID: \n- Point Name: WTS1.TDS\n- Point Type: analog-input\n- Unit: no-units\n- Value Example: N/A\n- Related points in same device: PH, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance\n\nTask: Map this BMS point to the corresponding EnOS point name.\nThe EnOS point name should follow the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\n\nExamples:\n- Chiller supply temperature → CH_raw_temp_chws\n- AHU return temperature → AHU_raw_temp_rt\n- Fan power measurement → FCU_raw_power_fan\n\nProvide:\n1. EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "To map the BMS point \"WTS1.TDS\" to the EnOS schema, we need to understand the context and the type of measurement it represents. However, the provided information lacks specific details about the device type and the exact nature of the measurement. Given the point name \"WTS1.TDS\" and its type as \"analog-input\" with no units, we can make some educated assumptions.\n\n1. **EnOS Point Name**: Since \"WTS1\" could potentially refer to a Water Treatment System or a Water Tank System, and \"TDS\" typically stands for Total Dissolved Solids, the EnOS point name could be:\n   - WTS_raw_tds\n\n2. **Confidence Score**: 0.6\n\n3. **Explanation of Mapping**: \n   - **Device Type Category**: Assumed to be \"WTS\" based on the point name, which could stand for Water Treatment System or Water Tank System.\n   - **Measurement Type**: \"raw\" is used as a generic term for direct measurements.\n   - **Point**: \"tds\" is derived from the point name \"TDS\", which commonly stands for Total Dissolved Solids, a typical measurement in water systems.\n   - The confidence score is moderate due to the lack of specific information about the device type and the exact nature of the measurement. Additional context about the device and its function would help refine the mapping.",

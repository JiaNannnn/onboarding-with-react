  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in mapping Building Management System (BMS) points to EnOS schema points.\n\nDevice Point Context:\n- Device Type: \n- Device ID: \n- Point Name: CH-4.HeatBalance\n- Point Type: analog-input\n- Unit: no-units\n- Value Example: N/A\n- Related points in same device: PH, TDS, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance\n\nTask: Map this BMS point to the corresponding EnOS point name.\nThe EnOS point name should follow the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\n\nExamples:\n- Chiller supply temperature → CH_raw_temp_chws\n- AHU return temperature → AHU_raw_temp_rt\n- Fan power measurement → FCU_raw_power_fan\n\nProvide:\n1. EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: CH_raw_balance_heat\n2. Confidence score: 0.9\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: \n\nThe BMS point \"CH-4.HeatBalance\" is associated with a chiller device, as indicated by the prefix \"CH\". The point type is \"analog-input\", which suggests it is a raw measurement. The term \"HeatBalance\" refers to a measurement related to heat, which aligns with the \"balance\" aspect of energy or thermal management in chillers. Following the EnOS naming convention, the point name is constructed by combining the device type category \"CH\" (for chiller), the measurement type \"balance\" (indicating a balance or equilibrium measurement), and the specific point \"heat\" (referring to the heat aspect of the balance). The confidence score is 0.9 due to the clear indication of the device type and measurement type, though the lack of a specific unit or example value introduces slight uncertainty.",

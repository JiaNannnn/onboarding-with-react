  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in mapping Building Management System (BMS) points to EnOS schema points.\n\nDevice Point Context:\n- Device Type: \n- Device ID: \n- Point Name: CH-1.HeatBalance\n- Point Type: analog-input\n- Unit: no-units\n- Value Example: N/A\n- Related points in same device: PH, TDS, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance\n\nTask: Map this BMS point to the corresponding EnOS point name.\nThe EnOS point name should follow the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\n\nExamples:\n- Chiller supply temperature → CH_raw_temp_chws\n- AHU return temperature → AHU_raw_temp_rt\n- Fan power measurement → FCU_raw_power_fan\n\nProvide:\n1. EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: CH_raw_balance_heat\n2. Confidence score: 0.8\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: \n\nThe BMS point \"CH-1.HeatBalance\" is associated with a chiller device, as indicated by the \"CH\" prefix. The point type is \"analog-input,\" which suggests it is a measurement rather than a control point. The term \"HeatBalance\" implies a measurement related to thermal energy or heat transfer within the chiller system. In the EnOS schema, the format requires specifying the device type category, the measurement type, and the specific point. \n\n- \"CH\" is used for the chiller device type category.\n- \"raw\" is used to indicate that this is a direct measurement point.\n- \"balance\" is used to denote the type of measurement related to energy balance.\n- \"heat\" specifies that the measurement is related to heat or thermal energy.\n\nThe confidence score is 0.8 because while the mapping follows the logical structure and naming conventions, the lack of a specific unit or example value for \"HeatBalance\" introduces some uncertainty about the exact nature of the measurement.",

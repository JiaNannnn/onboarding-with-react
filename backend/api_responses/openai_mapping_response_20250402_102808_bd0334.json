  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in mapping Building Management System (BMS) points to EnOS schema points.\n\nDevice Point Context:\n- Device Type: AHUEnergy\n- Device ID: \n- Point Name: AHUEnergy.Daily-tRh\n- Point Type: analog-input\n- Unit: no-units\n- Value Example: N/A\n- Related points in same device: Ahu-kW, Ahu-Ton, Daily-kWh, Monthly-kWh, Quarterly-MWh, Yearly-MWh, Monthly-tRh, Quarterly-KtRh, Yearly-KtRh, Daily-Efficiency, Monthly-Efficiency, Quarterly-Efficiency, Yearly-Efficiency\n\nTask: Map this BMS point to the corresponding EnOS point name.\nThe EnOS point name should follow the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\n\nExamples:\n- Chiller supply temperature → CH_raw_temp_chws\n- AHU return temperature → AHU_raw_temp_rt\n- Fan power measurement → FCU_raw_power_fan\n\nProvide:\n1. EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: AHU_raw_energy_dailytrh\n2. Confidence score: 0.9\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: The BMS point \"AHUEnergy.Daily-tRh\" is associated with an Air Handling Unit (AHU) and represents a daily measurement of thermal energy in ton-hours (tRh). In the EnOS schema, the point name is constructed by combining the device type category (AHU), the measurement type (energy), and the specific point (dailytrh) to reflect the daily thermal energy measurement. The prefix \"raw\" is used to indicate that this is a direct measurement from the device. The confidence score is 0.9 due to the assumption that \"tRh\" refers to thermal energy in ton-hours, which aligns with the related points and typical BMS naming conventions.",

  "response": "1. EnOS point name: AHU_raw_energy_ton\n2. Confidence score: 0.9\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: The BMS point \"AHUEnergy.Ahu-Ton\" represents a measurement related to energy usage or capacity in tons for an Air Handling Unit (AHU). In the EnOS schema, the point name is structured to reflect the device type (AHU), the category of the measurement (raw), the type of measurement (energy), and the specific point (ton). The mapping follows the pattern of using \"raw\" for direct measurements and \"energy\" to denote the type of measurement, with \"ton\" indicating the specific unit or aspect being measured. The confidence score is 0.9 due to the lack of a specific unit, which suggests a conceptual mapping rather than a direct one.",

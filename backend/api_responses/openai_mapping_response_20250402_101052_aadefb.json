  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in mapping Building Management System (BMS) points to EnOS schema points.\n\nDevice Point Context:\n- Device Type: \n- Device ID: \n- Point Name: CH-4.HeatBalance\n- Point Type: analog-input\n- Unit: no-units\n- Value Example: N/A\n- Related points in same device: PH, TDS, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance\n\nTask: Map this BMS point to the corresponding EnOS point name.\nThe EnOS point name should follow the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\n\nExamples:\n- Chiller supply temperature → CH_raw_temp_chws\n- AHU return temperature → AHU_raw_temp_rt\n- Fan power measurement → FCU_raw_power_fan\n\nProvide:\n1. EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: CH_raw_balance_heat\n2. Confidence score: 0.8\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: \n\nThe BMS point \"CH-4.HeatBalance\" is associated with a chiller, as indicated by the prefix \"CH\". The point type is \"analog-input\", which suggests it is a raw measurement rather than a calculated or derived value. The term \"HeatBalance\" implies a measurement related to thermal energy or heat transfer, which aligns with the concept of \"balance\" in energy systems. In the EnOS schema, the format requires specifying the device type category, the measurement type, and the specific point. Therefore, \"CH\" is used for the chiller device type category, \"raw\" indicates it is a direct measurement, \"balance\" is used to denote the type of measurement related to energy balance, and \"heat\" specifies the focus on thermal energy. The confidence score is 0.8 due to the lack of specific unit information and example values, which makes it slightly uncertain whether \"HeatBalance\" is the most accurate descriptor for this point.",

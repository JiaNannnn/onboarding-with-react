  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in mapping Building Management System (BMS) points to EnOS schema points.\n\nDevice Point Context:\n- Device Type: \n- Device ID: \n- Point Name: WTS1.TDS\n- Point Type: analog-input\n- Unit: no-units\n- Value Example: N/A\n- Related points in same device: PH, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance\n\nTask: Map this BMS point to the corresponding EnOS point name.\nThe EnOS point name should follow the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\n\nExamples:\n- Chiller supply temperature → CH_raw_temp_chws\n- AHU return temperature → AHU_raw_temp_rt\n- Fan power measurement → FCU_raw_power_fan\n\nProvide:\n1. EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "To map the BMS point \"WTS1.TDS\" to the EnOS schema, we need to understand the context and the naming conventions used in the examples provided. However, the given information lacks specific details about the device type and the exact nature of the measurement. Based on the point name \"WTS1.TDS\" and related points, we can make some educated assumptions.\n\n1. **EnOS point name**: WTS_raw_tds\n2. **Confidence score**: 0.6\n3. **Explanation of mapping**: \n   - **Device Type**: The prefix \"WTS\" could suggest a Water Treatment System or Water Tank System, but without explicit information, this is an assumption.\n   - **Measurement Type**: \"TDS\" typically stands for Total Dissolved Solids, a common measurement in water quality systems.\n   - **Point Type**: The point type is \"analog-input,\" which aligns with a measurement like TDS.\n   - **Unit**: The unit is \"no-units,\" which is unusual for TDS, as it is often measured in ppm (parts per million), but this could be a configuration oversight or simplification.\n   - **Related Points**: The related points like \"PH\" and \"HeatBalance\" suggest this device is involved in water quality or thermal management, supporting the assumption of a water-related system.\n\nGiven these assumptions, the EnOS point name \"WTS_raw_tds\" is constructed to reflect a raw measurement of Total Dissolved Solids from a Water Treatment System. The confidence score is moderate due to the lack of specific device type information.",

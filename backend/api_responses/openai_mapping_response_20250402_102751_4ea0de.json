  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in mapping Building Management System (BMS) points to EnOS schema points.\n\nDevice Point Context:\n- Device Type: \n- Device ID: \n- Point Name: CH-5.HeatBalance\n- Point Type: analog-input\n- Unit: no-units\n- Value Example: N/A\n- Related points in same device: PH, TDS, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance\n\nTask: Map this BMS point to the corresponding EnOS point name.\nThe EnOS point name should follow the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\n\nExamples:\n- Chiller supply temperature → CH_raw_temp_chws\n- AHU return temperature → AHU_raw_temp_rt\n- Fan power measurement → FCU_raw_power_fan\n\nProvide:\n1. EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: CH_raw_balance_heat\n2. Confidence score: 0.8\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: \n\nThe BMS point \"CH-5.HeatBalance\" is associated with a chiller device, as indicated by the \"CH\" prefix. The point type is \"analog-input,\" which suggests it is a measurement rather than a control point. The term \"HeatBalance\" implies a measurement related to the thermal energy balance or heat transfer within the chiller system. \n\nFollowing the EnOS naming convention:\n- \"CH\" is used for the chiller device type.\n- \"raw\" indicates that this is a direct measurement from the device.\n- \"balance\" is derived from \"HeatBalance,\" indicating the type of measurement.\n- \"heat\" specifies the nature of the balance being measured.\n\nGiven the lack of specific units and example values, the confidence score is set at 0.8, as there is some ambiguity in the exact nature of the \"HeatBalance\" measurement without additional context.",

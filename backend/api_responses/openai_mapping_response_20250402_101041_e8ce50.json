  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in mapping Building Management System (BMS) points to EnOS schema points.\n\nDevice Point Context:\n- Device Type: \n- Device ID: \n- Point Name: CH-2.HeatBalance\n- Point Type: analog-input\n- Unit: no-units\n- Value Example: N/A\n- Related points in same device: PH, TDS, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance\n\nTask: Map this BMS point to the corresponding EnOS point name.\nThe EnOS point name should follow the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\n\nExamples:\n- Chiller supply temperature → CH_raw_temp_chws\n- AHU return temperature → AHU_raw_temp_rt\n- Fan power measurement → FCU_raw_power_fan\n\nProvide:\n1. EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: CH_raw_balance_heat\n2. Confidence score: 0.8\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: \n\nThe BMS point \"CH-2.HeatBalance\" appears to be related to a chiller device, as indicated by the \"CH\" prefix. The term \"HeatBalance\" suggests a measurement related to the thermal energy balance or heat exchange within the chiller system. In the EnOS schema, the point name is constructed using the format DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT. Here, \"CH\" is used for the chiller device type, \"raw\" is a placeholder for the category, \"balance\" is used to represent the measurement type related to heat balance, and \"heat\" specifies the point. The confidence score is 0.8 due to the lack of specific unit information and the repetition of \"HeatBalance\" in related points, which may indicate a need for further context to ensure precise mapping.",

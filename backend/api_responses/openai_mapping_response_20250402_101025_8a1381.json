  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in mapping Building Management System (BMS) points to EnOS schema points.\n\nDevice Point Context:\n- Device Type: \n- Device ID: \n- Point Name: WTS1.PH\n- Point Type: analog-input\n- Unit: no-units\n- Value Example: N/A\n- Related points in same device: TDS, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance\n\nTask: Map this BMS point to the corresponding EnOS point name.\nThe EnOS point name should follow the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\n\nExamples:\n- Chiller supply temperature → CH_raw_temp_chws\n- AHU return temperature → AHU_raw_temp_rt\n- Fan power measurement → FCU_raw_power_fan\n\nProvide:\n1. EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: WT_raw_ph_wts1\n2. Confidence score: 0.8\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: \n\nThe BMS point \"WTS1.PH\" appears to be related to a water treatment system (WTS), as indicated by the prefix \"WTS1\". The \"PH\" suggests that this point measures the pH level, which is a common parameter in water treatment systems. Since the point type is \"analog-input\" and the unit is \"no-units\", it aligns with the nature of pH measurements, which are unitless. \n\nFollowing the EnOS naming convention:\n- DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY: WT (assuming Water Treatment as the device type category)\n- MEASUREMENT_TYPE: raw_ph (indicating a raw pH measurement)\n- POINT: wts1 (to specify the particular point or sensor)\n\nThe confidence score is 0.8 due to the assumption that \"WTS\" refers to a water treatment system and the lack of additional context about the device type.",

  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in mapping Building Management System (BMS) points to EnOS schema points.\n\nDevice Point Context:\n- Device Type: FCUEnergy\n- Device ID: \n- Point Name: FCUEnergy.Yearly-KtRh\n- Point Type: analog-input\n- Unit: no-units\n- Value Example: N/A\n- Related points in same device: Fcu-Ton, Daily-tRh, Monthly-tRh, Quarterly-KtRh\n\nTask: Map this BMS point to the corresponding EnOS point name.\nThe EnOS point name should follow the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\n\nExamples:\n- Chiller supply temperature → CH_raw_temp_chws\n- AHU return temperature → AHU_raw_temp_rt\n- Fan power measurement → FCU_raw_power_fan\n\nProvide:\n1. EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: FCU_raw_energy_yearly\n2. Confidence score: 0.9\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: \n\nThe BMS point \"FCUEnergy.Yearly-KtRh\" is associated with a device type of \"FCUEnergy\" and represents a yearly energy measurement. In the EnOS schema, the point name is structured to include the device type category, the measurement type, and the specific point. \n\n- \"FCU\" is derived from the device type \"FCUEnergy,\" indicating it is related to a Fan Coil Unit.\n- \"raw\" is used to denote that this is a direct measurement or raw data point.\n- \"energy\" is used as the measurement type since the point name includes \"Energy\" and the related points suggest energy-related measurements (e.g., \"Fcu-Ton,\" \"Daily-tRh\").\n- \"yearly\" specifies the time frame of the measurement, as indicated by \"Yearly\" in the BMS point name.\n\nThe confidence score is 0.9 because the mapping follows the provided examples and logical structure, but there is a slight uncertainty due to the lack of a specific value example and the unit being \"no-units,\" which might imply a different interpretation.",

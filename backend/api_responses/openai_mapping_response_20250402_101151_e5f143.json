EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: AHU_raw_efficiency_quarterly\n2. Confidence score: 0.95\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: The BMS point \"AHUEnergy.Quarterly-Efficiency\" is related to the efficiency measurement of an Air Handling Unit (AHU) on a quarterly basis. According to the EnOS schema format, the point name is constructed by combining the device type category (AHU), the measurement type (efficiency), and the specific time period (quarterly). The prefix \"raw\" is used to indicate that this is a direct measurement point. The mapping follows the pattern observed in the examples provided, ensuring consistency with the EnOS naming convention.",

  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in mapping Building Management System (BMS) points to EnOS schema points.\n\nDevice Point Context:\n- Device Type: AHUEnergy\n- Device ID: \n- Point Name: AHUEnergy.Yearly-Efficiency\n- Point Type: analog-input\n- Unit: no-units\n- Value Example: N/A\n- Related points in same device: Ahu-kW, Ahu-Ton, Daily-kWh, Monthly-kWh, Quarterly-MWh, Yearly-MWh, Daily-tRh, Monthly-tRh, Quarterly-KtRh, Yearly-KtRh, Daily-Efficiency, Monthly-Efficiency, Quarterly-Efficiency\n\nTask: Map this BMS point to the corresponding EnOS point name.\nThe EnOS point name should follow the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\n\nExamples:\n- Chiller supply temperature → CH_raw_temp_chws\n- AHU return temperature → AHU_raw_temp_rt\n- Fan power measurement → FCU_raw_power_fan\n\nProvide:\n1. EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: AHU_raw_efficiency_yearly\n2. Confidence score: 0.9\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: The BMS point \"AHUEnergy.Yearly-Efficiency\" is related to the efficiency measurement of an Air Handling Unit (AHU) on a yearly basis. According to the EnOS schema format, the point name should start with the device type category, which is \"AHU\" for Air Handling Unit. The measurement type is \"efficiency,\" and the specific point is \"yearly,\" indicating the time frame of the measurement. Therefore, the EnOS point name is constructed as \"AHU_raw_efficiency_yearly,\" following the format DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT. The confidence score is 0.9, reflecting a high level of certainty based on the provided context and examples.",

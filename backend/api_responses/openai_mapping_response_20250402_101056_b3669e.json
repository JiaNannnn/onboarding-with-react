  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in mapping Building Management System (BMS) points to EnOS schema points.\n\nDevice Point Context:\n- Device Type: \n- Device ID: \n- Point Name: CH-5.HeatBalance\n- Point Type: analog-input\n- Unit: no-units\n- Value Example: N/A\n- Related points in same device: PH, TDS, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance\n\nTask: Map this BMS point to the corresponding EnOS point name.\nThe EnOS point name should follow the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\n\nExamples:\n- Chiller supply temperature → CH_raw_temp_chws\n- AHU return temperature → AHU_raw_temp_rt\n- Fan power measurement → FCU_raw_power_fan\n\nProvide:\n1. EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: CH_raw_heatbalance_hb\n2. Confidence score: 0.8\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: \n\nThe BMS point \"CH-5.HeatBalance\" is associated with a chiller device, as indicated by the prefix \"CH\". The point type is \"analog-input\", which suggests it is a raw measurement. The term \"HeatBalance\" is directly related to the measurement of heat balance within the chiller system. Following the EnOS naming convention, the point name is constructed by combining the device type category \"CH\" (for chiller), the measurement type \"heatbalance\", and the point type \"hb\" (an abbreviation for heat balance). The confidence score is 0.8 due to the repetition of \"HeatBalance\" in related points, which suggests a potential for ambiguity in the specific measurement context.",

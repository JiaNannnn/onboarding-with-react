  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in mapping Building Management System (BMS) points to EnOS schema points.\n\nDevice Point Context:\n- Device Type: AHUEnergy\n- Device ID: \n- Point Name: AHUEnergy.Yearly-KtRh\n- Point Type: analog-input\n- Unit: no-units\n- Value Example: N/A\n- Related points in same device: Ahu-kW, Ahu-Ton, Daily-kWh, Monthly-kWh, Quarterly-MWh, Yearly-MWh, Daily-tRh, Monthly-tRh, Quarterly-KtRh, Daily-Efficiency, Monthly-Efficiency, Quarterly-Efficiency, Yearly-Efficiency\n\nTask: Map this BMS point to the corresponding EnOS point name.\nThe EnOS point name should follow the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\n\nExamples:\n- Chiller supply temperature → CH_raw_temp_chws\n- AHU return temperature → AHU_raw_temp_rt\n- Fan power measurement → FCU_raw_power_fan\n\nProvide:\n1. EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: AHU_raw_energy_yearly\n2. Confidence score: 0.9\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: The BMS point \"AHUEnergy.Yearly-KtRh\" represents a yearly energy measurement for an Air Handling Unit (AHU). In the EnOS schema, the point name is structured to reflect the device type, measurement type, and the specific point. \"AHU\" indicates the device type, \"raw\" is used to denote the raw measurement data, \"energy\" specifies the type of measurement, and \"yearly\" indicates the time period of the measurement. The mapping aligns with the provided examples and the context of the related points, which also include yearly measurements.",

  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in mapping Building Management System (BMS) points to EnOS schema points.\n\nDevice Point Context:\n- Device Type: \n- Device ID: \n- Point Name: CH-3.HeatBalance\n- Point Type: analog-input\n- Unit: no-units\n- Value Example: N/A\n- Related points in same device: PH, TDS, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance\n\nTask: Map this BMS point to the corresponding EnOS point name.\nThe EnOS point name should follow the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\n\nExamples:\n- Chiller supply temperature → CH_raw_temp_chws\n- AHU return temperature → AHU_raw_temp_rt\n- Fan power measurement → FCU_raw_power_fan\n\nProvide:\n1. EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: CH_raw_balance_heat\n2. Confidence score: 0.8\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: The point name \"CH-3.HeatBalance\" suggests that it is related to a chiller (CH) and involves a heat balance measurement. In the EnOS schema, the device type category for chillers is typically abbreviated as \"CH\". The measurement type \"HeatBalance\" is directly related to the concept of energy or heat balance, which can be mapped to \"balance_heat\" in the EnOS naming convention. The point type \"analog-input\" indicates that it is a raw measurement, which aligns with the \"raw\" prefix in the EnOS point name. The confidence score is 0.8 due to the lack of specific unit information and the repetition of the point name, which may suggest additional context not provided.",

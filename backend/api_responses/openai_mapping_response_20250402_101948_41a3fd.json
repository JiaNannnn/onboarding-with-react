EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: AHU_raw_energy_monthlytrh\n\n2. Confidence score: 0.9\n\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: \n   - The device type is AHUEnergy, which corresponds to the \"AHU\" prefix in the EnOS point name.\n   - The point name \"Monthly-tRh\" indicates a measurement related to energy usage over a month, specifically in ton-hours (tRh). In the EnOS schema, this is represented by \"raw_energy\" for energy-related measurements.\n   - The \"Monthly\" aspect of the point name is directly included in the EnOS point name as \"monthly\" to specify the time period of the measurement.\n   - The \"tRh\" unit is included in the EnOS point name as \"trh\" to specify the type of energy measurement.\n   - The mapping follows the format DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT, resulting in \"AHU_raw_energy_monthlytrh\".",

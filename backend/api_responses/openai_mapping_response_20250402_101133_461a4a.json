  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in mapping Building Management System (BMS) points to EnOS schema points.\n\nDevice Point Context:\n- Device Type: AHUEnergy\n- Device ID: \n- Point Name: AHUEnergy.Monthly-tRh\n- Point Type: analog-input\n- Unit: no-units\n- Value Example: N/A\n- Related points in same device: Ahu-kW, Ahu-Ton, Daily-kWh, Monthly-kWh, Quarterly-MWh, Yearly-MWh, Daily-tRh, Quarterly-KtRh, Yearly-KtRh, Daily-Efficiency, Monthly-Efficiency, Quarterly-Efficiency, Yearly-Efficiency\n\nTask: Map this BMS point to the corresponding EnOS point name.\nThe EnOS point name should follow the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\n\nExamples:\n- Chiller supply temperature → CH_raw_temp_chws\n- AHU return temperature → AHU_raw_temp_rt\n- Fan power measurement → FCU_raw_power_fan\n\nProvide:\n1. EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: AHUEnergy_raw_energy_monthlytrh\n\n2. Confidence score: 0.9\n\n3. Brief explanation of mapping:\n   - The device type \"AHUEnergy\" is directly used as the prefix in the EnOS point name.\n   - The point name \"Monthly-tRh\" suggests a measurement related to energy consumption or usage over a month, specifically in ton-hours (tRh).\n   - The term \"Monthly\" indicates the measurement period, which is included in the EnOS point name as \"monthly\".\n   - The measurement type \"tRh\" is a specific energy unit, so it is included as \"trh\" in the EnOS point name.\n   - The point type \"analog-input\" suggests a raw measurement, so \"raw\" is included in the EnOS point name.\n   - The EnOS point name is constructed by combining these elements in the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT.",

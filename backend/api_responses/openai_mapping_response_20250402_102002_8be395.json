EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: AHU_raw_efficiency_quarterly\n2. Confidence score: 0.9\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: The BMS point \"AHUEnergy.Quarterly-Efficiency\" is associated with an Air Handling Unit (AHU) and represents a quarterly efficiency measurement. According to the EnOS naming convention, the point name should start with the device type category (AHU), followed by the measurement type (efficiency), and the specific point (quarterly). The term \"raw\" is used to indicate that this is a direct measurement or reading. The mapping aligns with the provided examples, ensuring consistency in naming conventions.",

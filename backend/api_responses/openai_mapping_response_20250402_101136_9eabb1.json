  "response": "1. EnOS point name: AHU_raw_energy_quarterly\n2. Confidence score: 0.9\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: The BMS point \"AHUEnergy.Quarterly-KtRh\" represents a quarterly energy measurement for an Air Handling Unit (AHU). In the EnOS schema, the point name is constructed by identifying the device type (AHU), the category of the measurement (raw), the type of measurement (energy), and the specific time frame or context (quarterly). The mapping follows the format provided in the examples, ensuring consistency with the naming convention. The confidence score is 0.9 due to the straightforward nature of the mapping, though the absence of a unit in the BMS point introduces slight uncertainty.",

  "response": "1. EnOS point name: FCU_raw_energy_ton\n2. Confidence score: 0.9\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: The BMS point \"FCUEnergy.Fcu-Ton\" is associated with an FCU (Fan Coil Unit) and represents an energy-related measurement. The EnOS schema format requires the point name to include the device type category (FCU), the measurement type (energy), and the specific point (ton). Since the point type is \"analog-input\" and the unit is \"no-units,\" it suggests a raw measurement of energy usage in tons. Therefore, the EnOS point name is constructed as \"FCU_raw_energy_ton\" to reflect this mapping. The confidence score is 0.9 due to the assumption that \"Ton\" refers to a measurement of energy usage, which aligns with the related points indicating energy consumption over different time periods.",

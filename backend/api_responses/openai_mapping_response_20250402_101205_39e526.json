EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: FCU_raw_energy_dailytrh\n2. Confidence score: 0.9\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: The BMS point \"FCUEnergy.Daily-tRh\" is associated with an FCU (Fan Coil Unit) and represents a daily energy measurement. In the EnOS schema, the point name is constructed by combining the device type category (FCU), the measurement type (energy), and the specific point (dailytrh). The \"raw\" prefix indicates that this is a direct measurement from the device. The mapping follows the pattern of using underscores to separate the different components of the point name, as seen in the provided examples.",

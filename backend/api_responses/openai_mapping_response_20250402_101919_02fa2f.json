  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in mapping Building Management System (BMS) points to EnOS schema points.\n\nDevice Point Context:\n- Device Type: \n- Device ID: \n- Point Name: CH-4.HeatBalance\n- Point Type: analog-input\n- Unit: no-units\n- Value Example: N/A\n- Related points in same device: PH, TDS, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance\n\nTask: Map this BMS point to the corresponding EnOS point name.\nThe EnOS point name should follow the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\n\nExamples:\n- Chiller supply temperature → CH_raw_temp_chws\n- AHU return temperature → AHU_raw_temp_rt\n- Fan power measurement → FCU_raw_power_fan\n\nProvide:\n1. EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: CH_raw_balance_heat\n2. Confidence score: 0.8\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: The BMS point \"CH-4.HeatBalance\" is associated with a chiller device, as indicated by the \"CH\" prefix. The point type is \"analog-input,\" which suggests it is a raw measurement. The term \"HeatBalance\" implies a measurement related to heat, which aligns with the \"balance_heat\" in the EnOS schema. The EnOS point name is constructed by combining the device type category \"CH\" (for chiller), the measurement type \"raw,\" and the specific point \"balance_heat,\" following the format provided in the examples. The confidence score is 0.8 due to the repetition of \"HeatBalance\" in related points, which suggests potential ambiguity in the exact measurement context.",

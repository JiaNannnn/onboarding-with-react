  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in mapping Building Management System (BMS) points to EnOS schema points.\n\nDevice Point Context:\n- Device Type: \n- Device ID: \n- Point Name: WTS1.PH\n- Point Type: analog-input\n- Unit: no-units\n- Value Example: N/A\n- Related points in same device: TDS, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance\n\nTask: Map this BMS point to the corresponding EnOS point name.\nThe EnOS point name should follow the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\n\nExamples:\n- Chiller supply temperature → CH_raw_temp_chws\n- AHU return temperature → AHU_raw_temp_rt\n- Fan power measurement → FCU_raw_power_fan\n\nProvide:\n1. EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: WT_raw_ph_wts1\n2. Confidence score: 0.8\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: \n\nThe point name \"WTS1.PH\" suggests that it is related to a water treatment system (WTS) and is measuring pH levels. In the EnOS schema, the device type category for water treatment systems can be abbreviated as \"WT\". The measurement type is \"ph\", which is directly derived from the point name. The point name includes \"WTS1\", indicating a specific identifier for the device or sensor, which is appended at the end of the EnOS point name. The format follows the structure: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT, resulting in \"WT_raw_ph_wts1\". The confidence score is 0.8 due to the assumption that \"WTS\" refers to a water treatment system and the lack of additional context about the specific device type.",

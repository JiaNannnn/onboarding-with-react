  "response": "1. EnOS point name: FCU_raw_energy_ton\n2. Confidence score: 0.9\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: The BMS point \"FCUEnergy.Fcu-Ton\" appears to represent an energy measurement related to a Fan Coil Unit (FCU). The term \"Ton\" is commonly used in HVAC systems to denote a unit of cooling capacity, which is related to energy usage. In the EnOS schema, the format \"DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\" is used, where \"FCU\" is the device type category, \"raw\" indicates a direct measurement, \"energy\" is the measurement type, and \"ton\" specifies the unit or context of the measurement. The confidence score is 0.9 due to the assumption that \"Ton\" refers to energy usage in terms of cooling capacity, which aligns with the related points indicating energy measurements over different time periods.",

EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: CH_raw_balance_heat\n2. Confidence score: 0.8\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: \n\nThe BMS point \"CH-2.HeatBalance\" is associated with a chiller device, as indicated by the prefix \"CH\". The point type is \"analog-input\", which suggests it is a raw measurement rather than a calculated or derived value. The term \"HeatBalance\" likely refers to a measurement related to the thermal energy balance or heat transfer within the chiller system. Following the EnOS naming convention, the point name is constructed by identifying the device type category (CH for chiller), the measurement type (balance for HeatBalance), and the specific point (heat). The confidence score is 0.8 due to the assumption that \"HeatBalance\" directly translates to a balance measurement related to heat, but without additional context or a specific unit, there is some uncertainty.",

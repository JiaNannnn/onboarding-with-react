  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in mapping Building Management System (BMS) points to EnOS schema points.\n\nDevice Point Context:\n- Device Type: \n- Device ID: \n- Point Name: CH-3.HeatBalance\n- Point Type: analog-input\n- Unit: no-units\n- Value Example: N/A\n- Related points in same device: PH, TDS, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance\n\nTask: Map this BMS point to the corresponding EnOS point name.\nThe EnOS point name should follow the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\n\nExamples:\n- Chiller supply temperature → CH_raw_temp_chws\n- AHU return temperature → AHU_raw_temp_rt\n- Fan power measurement → FCU_raw_power_fan\n\nProvide:\n1. EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: CH_raw_energy_heatbalance\n2. Confidence score: 0.8\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: \n\nThe BMS point \"CH-3.HeatBalance\" appears to be related to a chiller (indicated by \"CH\"), and \"HeatBalance\" suggests it is a measurement related to energy or thermal balance. In the EnOS schema, the prefix \"CH\" is used for chiller-related points. The term \"HeatBalance\" is mapped to \"energy\" as it typically involves calculations of energy input and output to maintain thermal equilibrium. The suffix \"heatbalance\" is used to maintain specificity. The confidence score is 0.8 due to the lack of specific unit or value example, which makes it slightly uncertain if \"energy\" is the most precise category.",

  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in mapping Building Management System (BMS) points to EnOS schema points.\n\nDevice Point Context:\n- Device Type: \n- Device ID: \n- Point Name: CH-5.HeatBalance\n- Point Type: analog-input\n- Unit: no-units\n- Value Example: N/A\n- Related points in same device: PH, TDS, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance\n\nTask: Map this BMS point to the corresponding EnOS point name.\nThe EnOS point name should follow the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\n\nExamples:\n- Chiller supply temperature → CH_raw_temp_chws\n- AHU return temperature → AHU_raw_temp_rt\n- Fan power measurement → FCU_raw_power_fan\n\nProvide:\n1. EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: CH_raw_balance_heat\n2. Confidence score: 0.8\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: \n\nThe BMS point \"CH-5.HeatBalance\" is associated with a device that likely involves heating or thermal management, given the context of \"HeatBalance.\" The device type is not explicitly provided, but the prefix \"CH\" suggests it could be a chiller or a similar device. In the EnOS schema, the point name should reflect the device type category, measurement type, and specific point. \n\n- \"CH\" is used as the device type category, assuming it stands for a chiller.\n- \"raw\" is used to indicate that this is a direct measurement or input.\n- \"balance\" is used to represent the concept of \"HeatBalance.\"\n- \"heat\" is added to specify the type of balance being measured.\n\nThe confidence score is 0.8 due to the assumption about the device type and the interpretation of \"HeatBalance\" without additional context.",

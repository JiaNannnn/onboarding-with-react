  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in mapping Building Management System (BMS) points to EnOS schema points.\n\nDevice Point Context:\n- Device Type: \n- Device ID: \n- Point Name: CH-1.HeatBalance\n- Point Type: analog-input\n- Unit: no-units\n- Value Example: N/A\n- Related points in same device: PH, TDS, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance, HeatBalance\n\nTask: Map this BMS point to the corresponding EnOS point name.\nThe EnOS point name should follow the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\n\nExamples:\n- Chiller supply temperature → CH_raw_temp_chws\n- AHU return temperature → AHU_raw_temp_rt\n- Fan power measurement → FCU_raw_power_fan\n\nProvide:\n1. EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: CH_raw_balance_heat\n2. Confidence score: 0.8\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: \n\nThe BMS point \"CH-1.HeatBalance\" is associated with a chiller, as indicated by the \"CH\" prefix. The point type is \"analog-input,\" which suggests it is a measurement rather than a control point. The term \"HeatBalance\" implies a measurement related to the thermal energy balance or heat transfer within the chiller system. In the EnOS schema, the format requires specifying the device type category, measurement type, and point. \n\n- \"CH\" is used to denote the chiller device type.\n- \"raw\" is used to indicate that this is a direct measurement or raw data point.\n- \"balance\" is used to represent the concept of heat balance.\n- \"heat\" is used to specify the type of balance being measured.\n\nGiven these considerations, the EnOS point name \"CH_raw_balance_heat\" is constructed to reflect the nature of the measurement, aligning with the provided examples. The confidence score of 0.8 reflects a reasonable certainty based on the available information, though the lack of a specific unit or example value introduces some ambiguity.",

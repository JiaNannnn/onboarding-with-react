  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in mapping Building Management System (BMS) points to EnOS schema points.\n\nDevice Point Context:\n- Device Type: AHUEnergy\n- Device ID: \n- Point Name: AHUEnergy.Daily-tRh\n- Point Type: analog-input\n- Unit: no-units\n- Value Example: N/A\n- Related points in same device: Ahu-kW, Ahu-Ton, Daily-kWh, Monthly-kWh, Quarterly-MWh, Yearly-MWh, Monthly-tRh, Quarterly-KtRh, Yearly-KtRh, Daily-Efficiency, Monthly-Efficiency, Quarterly-Efficiency, Yearly-Efficiency\n\nTask: Map this BMS point to the corresponding EnOS point name.\nThe EnOS point name should follow the format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT\n\nExamples:\n- Chiller supply temperature → CH_raw_temp_chws\n- AHU return temperature → AHU_raw_temp_rt\n- Fan power measurement → FCU_raw_power_fan\n\nProvide:\n1. EnOS point name (exact format as shown in examples)\n2. Confidence score (0-1)\n3. Brief explanation of mapping\n",
  "response": "1. EnOS point name: AHU_raw_energy_dailytrh\n2. Confidence score: 0.9\n3. Brief explanation of mapping: \n\nThe BMS point \"AHUEnergy.Daily-tRh\" is associated with an Air Handling Unit (AHU) and represents a daily measurement of thermal energy in ton-hours (tRh). In the EnOS schema, the point name is constructed by following a specific format: DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY_MEASUREMENT_TYPE_POINT. \n\n- DEVICE_TYPE_CATEGORY: \"AHU\" indicates the device type category, which is an Air Handling Unit.\n- MEASUREMENT_TYPE: \"raw_energy\" is used to denote raw energy measurements.\n- POINT: \"dailytrh\" is derived from the original point name \"Daily-tRh,\" where \"daily\" specifies the time period of the measurement, and \"trh\" is a common abbreviation for ton-hours.\n\nThe confidence score is 0.9 because the mapping follows the provided format and examples closely, but there is a slight uncertainty due to the lack of explicit unit conversion or additional context about the specific usage of \"tRh\" in the EnOS schema.",

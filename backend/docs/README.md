# BMS Mapping Enhancement Project

## Overview

This project enhances the Building Management System (BMS) to EnOS mapping capabilities, enabling more accurate, intelligent, and adaptive mapping of BMS points to standardized EnOS schema points. The system incorporates advanced AI techniques, reflection patterns, and continuous learning to improve mapping quality over time.

## Documentation

This directory contains detailed documentation on the architecture, implementation, and use of the enhanced mapping system:

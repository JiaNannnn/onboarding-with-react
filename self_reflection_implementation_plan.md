# Self-Reflection and Chain of Thought Implementation Plan for BMS Mapping System

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for integrating self-reflection and Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning into our BMS-to-EnOS point mapping system, inspired by research on LLM agents. The goal is to improve mapping accuracy through structured thinking processes that allow the LLM to better understand point relationships and reconsider failed mappings.

## Current State Assessment
- Current mapping system uses direct LLM prompting with contextual information
- `mapping_patterns.json` provides pattern matching capabilities
- Fallback to "unknown" when validation fails
- No feedback loop or explicit reasoning structure during mapping

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Enhanced Reasoning Architecture
- [ ] Design reflection and CoT API endpoints
- [ ] Modify `EnOSMapper` class to support reasoning cycles
- [ ] Create logging system for reasoning and reflection data
- [ ] Implement reasoning trigger conditions (format errors, low confidence, complex point types)

### Phase 2: Chain of Thought Components for Grouping
- [ ] Implement step-by-step reasoning for device type identification
  - [ ] Extract hierarchical components from point naming conventions
  - [ ] Analyze relationships between points within the same system
  - [ ] Develop confidence scoring for group assignments
- [ ] Create group verification mechanisms
  - [ ] Compare group assignments with known device type patterns
  - [ ] Generate explanations for grouping decisions

### Phase 3: Self-Reflection Components for Mapping
- [ ] Implement point decomposition analysis
  - [ ] Extract semantic components from point names (e.g., "CWP", "VSD", "Hz")
  - [ ] Link components to EnOS schema concepts
- [ ] Create format error reflection
  - [ ] Analyze LLM responses that fail validation
  - [ ] Implement format correction mechanisms
- [ ] Add semantic reflection for "unknown" mappings
  - [ ] Compare with similar successfully mapped points
  - [ ] Generate explanations for mapping failures

### Phase 4: Integrated Reasoning Pipeline
- [ ] Implement mapping attempts with explicit CoT reasoning
  - [ ] Define step-by-step mapping decision tree
  - [ ] Document each mapping consideration with confidence levels
- [ ] Add secondary mapping attempts based on reflection
- [ ] Develop conflict resolution for multiple potential mappings
- [ ] Create cross-verification between grouping and mapping decisions

### Phase 5: Frontend Integration
- [ ] Update `PointsTable` to display reasoning and reflection data
- [ ] Add reasoning toggle controls and visualization
- [ ] Implement reasoning history viewing
- [ ] Create reasoning performance metrics dashboard

### Phase 6: Continuous Improvement System
- [ ] Design pattern extraction from successful reasoning chains
- [ ] Automate `mapping_patterns.json` updates from reasoning data
- [ ] Implement A/B testing for different reasoning strategies
- [ ] Create periodic reasoning effectiveness reports

## Technical Implementation Details

### Key Classes and Methods to Modify
- `EnOSMapper.map_points` - Add reasoning and reflection cycles
- `EnOSMapper._validate_enos_format` - Include reasoning for format analysis
- `EnOSMapper._generate_mapping_prompt` - Enhance with CoT instructions and reflection context
- `GroupingService.group_points` - Add CoT reasoning for device type identification

### New Components
```python
class ReasoningEngine:
    def chain_of_thought_grouping(self, points_batch):
        # Generate step-by-step reasoning for device type grouping
        pass
        
    def chain_of_thought_mapping(self, point_data, device_group):
        # Generate step-by-step reasoning for point mapping
        pass
        
    def reflect_on_mapping(self, point_data, failed_result, error_type):
        # Generate reflection on why mapping failed
        pass
        
    def generate_refined_prompt(self, point_data, reasoning_chain, reflection=None):
        # Create improved prompt based on reasoning and reflection
        pass
        
    def store_reasoning_data(self, point_id, reasoning_chain, reflection, outcome):
        # Log reasoning for analysis
        pass
```

### Sample CoT Reasoning Process for Grouping
1. Input: Batch of points with names like "CH-SYS-1.CWP.VSD.Hz", "CH-SYS-1.CWP.Status", etc.
2. CoT Step 1: "Analyzing prefix patterns. 'CH-SYS-1' appears consistently, indicating a chiller system."
3. CoT Step 2: "Identifying components: CWP likely means Chilled Water Pump, part of the chiller system."
4. CoT Step 3: "Points contain operational parameters (Status, Hz) for the same component (CWP)."
5. CoT Conclusion: "This group should be classified as device type 'CH-SYS' (Chiller System)."

### Sample Combined CoT and Reflection Process for Mapping
1. Initial mapping with CoT: 
   - "Point 'CH-SYS-1.CWP.VSD.Hz' contains VSD (Variable Speed Drive) and Hz (frequency unit)."
   - "This indicates it measures the frequency of a pump's variable speed drive."
   - "In EnOS, pump frequency measurements are typically mapped to 'PUMP_frequency' or similar."
   - "Initial mapping: Unknown (validation failed)"
2. Reflection: "Format validation failed, but semantic analysis indicates a pump frequency measurement."
3. Secondary mapping with refined CoT:
   - "Previous mapping failed due to format issues, not semantic matching."
   - "The point measures frequency (Hz) of a chilled water pump (CWP) variable speed drive (VSD)."
   - "In the EnOS schema, 'PUMP_raw_frequency' is the standardized point for pump frequency measurements."
   - "Mapping: PUMP_raw_frequency"

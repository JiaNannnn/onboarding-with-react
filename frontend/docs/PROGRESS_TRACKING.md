# Progress Tracking Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the approach for tracking progress during the implementation of the frontend. It defines how tasks should be documented, measured, and reported to ensure transparent and efficient development.

## Progress Tracking System

### Milestone-Based Tracking

We follow a milestone-based tracking system aligned with the phases defined in the implementation plan:

1. **Phase 1**: Setup and Configuration
2. **Phase 2**: Core Components and State
3. **Phase 3**: Feature Implementation
4. **Phase 4**: Cross-Domain Adaptability
5. **Phase 5**: Testing and Optimization

### Task Status Categories

Each task can have one of the following statuses:

- **🆕 Not Started**: Task is defined but work hasn't begun
- **🏗️ In Progress**: Work on the task has started but is not complete
- **✅ Complete**: Task is implemented and passes all acceptance criteria
- **🧪 Testing**: Task is implemented and currently being tested
- **⚠️ Blocked**: Task cannot proceed due to dependencies or issues

## Progress Documentation

### Progress Report Format

Progress reports should be updated at least weekly and include:

1. **Summary**: Overall progress highlights
2. **Completed Tasks**: Tasks completed since the last report
3. **In-Progress Tasks**: Tasks currently being worked on
4. **Blocked Tasks**: Any tasks that are blocked with explanation
5. **Upcoming Tasks**: Tasks planned for the next period
6. **Risks and Issues**: Any identified risks or issues
7. **Metrics**: Progress metrics (see below)

### Progress Metrics

We track the following metrics:

1. **Task Completion Rate**: Percentage of completed tasks
2. **Phase Completion**: Percentage completion of each phase
3. **Type Safety Coverage**: Percentage of codebase with strict typing
4. **Test Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by tests

## Task Assignment Process

1. **Task Selection**: Team members select tasks from the implementation plan
2. **Task Assignment**: Tasks are assigned in the tracking document
3. **Status Updates**: Team members update task status as work progresses
4. **Completion Criteria**: Tasks are marked complete when they meet all acceptance criteria:
   - Code implemented
   - TypeScript compiles with no errors
   - Tests pass (if applicable)
   - Code review completed
   - Documentation updated

## Weekly Progress Check-In

Team members should provide updates on their assigned tasks during the weekly check-in:

1. What tasks were completed last week?
2. What tasks are in progress?
3. Are there any blockers or issues?
4. What tasks are planned for the coming week?
5. Are there any changes needed to the implementation plan?

## Reporting and Documentation

Progress will be tracked in the following locations:

1. **This Document**: For high-level progress tracking
2. **GitHub Issues**: For detailed task tracking
3. **Pull Requests**: For code review and task completion
4. **Weekly Reports**: Sent to stakeholders summarizing progress

## Adjusting the Plan

The implementation plan may need adjustments based on:

1. **Discovered Complexities**: Tasks that prove more complex than anticipated
2. **Changed Requirements**: Updates to project requirements
3. **Resource Changes**: Changes in team availability
4. **Technical Challenges**: Unforeseen technical issues

Any changes to the plan should be documented and communicated to all stakeholders.

# Cross-Domain Integration Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines our strategy for transforming the BMS onboarding system into a universal IoT integration platform capable of adapting to any device type or protocol without domain-specific constraints.

## Core Principles

1. **Domain Agnosticism**: Avoid embedding domain-specific knowledge that limits adaptability
2. **Self-Learning Design**: Create systems that learn and evolve with each integration
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Focus on statistical patterns rather than rule-based approaches
4. **User Empowerment**: Enable users to define their own classifications and integrations
5. **Protocol Independence**: Abstract away protocol-specific details for universal handling

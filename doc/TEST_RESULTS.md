## Grouping Pattern Analysis

### Naming Conventions

1. **Chiller System (CH-SYS)**
   - Format: `CH-SYS-[number].[component].[measurement]`
   - Examples:
     - `CH-SYS-1.CH.ModeStatus` (Chiller 1 mode status)
     - `CH-SYS-2.CHWP.RunStatus` (Chiller 2 chilled water pump run status)
     - `CH-SYS-3.CWP.FailStatus` (Chiller 3 condenser water pump fail status)

2. **Fan Coil Units (FCU)**
   - Format: `FCU_[building]_[floor/location].[measurement]`
   - Examples:
     - `FCU_01_25.RoomTemp` (FCU in building 01, location 25, room temperature)
     - `FCU_05_01_7.ValveOutput` (FCU in building 05, location 01-7, valve output)
     - `FCU_05_CMO_2.RunStatus` (FCU in building 05, CMO area 2, run status)

3. **Cooling Towers (CT)**
   - Format: `CT_[number].[measurement]`
   - Examples:
     - `CT_1.ModeStatus` (Cooling tower 1 mode status)
     - `CT_3.VSD.Hz` (Cooling tower 3 VSD frequency)
     - `CT_4.CWST` (Cooling tower 4 condenser water supply temperature)

### Component Identification

The CSV file contains the following HVAC system components:

1. **Chillers and Associated Equipment**:
   - `CH` - Chiller
   - `CHWP` - Chilled Water Pump
   - `CWP` - Condenser Water Pump
   - `CHWV` - Chilled Water Valve
   - `CWV` - Condenser Water Valve
   - `ATCS` - Automatic Temperature Control System

2. **Fan Coil Units**: 
   - Multiple FCUs across different buildings and locations
   - Common measurements include:
     - `RoomTemp` - Room temperature
     - `ValveOutput` - Valve control output
     - `RunStatus` - Operating status
     - `FanOutput` - Fan control output
     - `TempSetpoint` - Temperature setpoint

3. **Cooling Towers**:
   - `CT` units with associated measurements
   - Includes VSD (Variable Speed Drive) parameters
   - Water temperature measurements (CWST)

4. **Headers and Distribution**:
   - `CHW-Header` - Chilled water header
   - `CW-Header` - Condenser water header

## Test Results

The current grouping algorithm should be able to identify and categorize equipment types and instances based on the naming patterns in this dataset. 

Key challenges for the AI/LLM Engineer to address:

1. **Hierarchical Relations**: 
   - Equipment instances can have subcomponents and nested measurements
   - Example: CH-SYS-1 contains CH, CHWP, CWP, CHWV, etc.

2. **Multiple Naming Formats**:
   - Some points use dots as separators (CH-SYS-1.CH.ModeStatus)
   - Others use underscores (FCU_01_25_RoomTemp)
   - Some combine both approaches

3. **Implied Relationships**:
   - Some points like `FCU.FCU_01_25.TempSetpoint` have redundant or hierarchical prefixes
   - Points like `ChillerPlant` are high-level containers for other equipment

4. **Varied Component Identification**:
   - Some points directly name the component (CHWP = Chilled Water Pump)
   - Others use abbreviations or codes

The Grouping Agent will need to implement pattern recognition strategies that can handle these complex naming conventions while maintaining consistent hierarchical grouping.

## Recommendations for Implementation

1. **Develop Multiple Pattern Recognition Strategies**:
   - Direct regex pattern matching for standard formats
   - Hierarchical parsing for nested components
   - Semantic analysis for ambiguous cases

2. **Component Classification Dictionary**:
   - Build a comprehensive mapping of abbreviations to component types
   - Include variations and alternates (CH, Chiller, CH-SYS)

3. **Hierarchical Model Structure**:
   - Implement a tree-based representation for equipment hierarchies
   - Support parent-child relationships between equipment and subcomponents

4. **Validation Mechanisms**:
   - Implement consistency checks for grouping results
   - Flag anomalies or ambiguous classifications for human review

# BMS Onboarding System - Architecture & Implementation Overview

## 1. System Architecture

### 1.1 Agent-Based Pipeline Design

The BMS Onboarding System employs a multi-agent architecture to process Building Management System (BMS) data points and map them to EnOS model points. This architecture divides the complex processing into three specialized phases:

1. **Grouping Agent**: Organizes raw BMS points into logical equipment hierarchies
2. **Tagging Agent**: Applies standardized tags based on HVAC ontology
3. **Mapping Agent**: Maps tagged points to EnOS model points

This separation of concerns allows for:
- Specialized processing at each stage
- Improved maintainability and extensibility
- Better error isolation and handling
- Optimized performance for each specific task

### 1.2 Data Flow Architecture

The data flows through the system in a pipeline fashion:

```
Raw BMS Points → Grouping Agent → Grouped Points → Tagging Agent → Tagged Points → Mapping Agent → EnOS Mapped Points
```

Each stage enhances the data with additional structure and semantics, building upon the work of previous stages.

### 1.3 Service Orchestration

The `BMSOnboardingService` class coordinates the entire pipeline, handling:
- Initialization of agents with appropriate configurations
- Sequential processing of data through agents
- Batch processing for memory efficiency
- Error handling and recovery
- Result summarization and export

## 2. Component Design

### 2.1 Grouping Agent

**Purpose**: Organize raw BMS points into a hierarchical structure based on equipment types and instances.

**Key Functionalities**:
- Equipment type identification from point names
- Device instance extraction with pattern recognition
- Hierarchical grouping of points
- Detection of naming patterns
- Handling of malformed point names

**Input**: List of raw BMS points
**Output**: Hierarchical structure of points grouped by equipment type and instance

### 2.2 Tagging Agent

**Purpose**: Enhance points with standardized metadata based on HVAC ontology.

**Key Functionalities**:
- Component and subcomponent classification
- Point function determination (sensor, command, status, setpoint)
- Phenomenon and quantity identification
- Engineering unit inference
- Tag generation based on metadata
- Description enhancement

**Input**: Hierarchically grouped BMS points
**Output**: Same structure with enhanced point metadata (tags, components, functions, etc.)

### 2.3 Mapping Agent

**Purpose**: Map tagged BMS points to appropriate EnOS model points.

**Key Functionalities**:
- EnOS point candidate identification
- Confidence score calculation for mappings
- Transformation rule determination
- Validation of mappings
- Generation of mapping configurations

**Input**: Hierarchically grouped and tagged BMS points
**Output**: Mapping between BMS points and EnOS points with confidence scores

## 3. Data Models

### 3.1 Core Models

1. **BMSPoint**:
   - Represents a raw point from a BMS system
   - Contains basic properties like ID, name, type, unit

2. **TaggedBMSPoint** (extends BMSPoint):
   - Adds semantic metadata (tags, component, function, etc.)
   - Preserves all original BMSPoint data

3. **EnOSPoint**:
   - Represents a point in the EnOS model
   - Contains model ID, data type, units, etc.

4. **EnOSPointMapping**:
   - Links a TaggedBMSPoint to an EnOSPoint
   - Includes confidence score and transformation rules
   - Contains mapping type (auto, suggested, manual, unmapped)

### 3.2 Data Structures

The system uses a consistent hierarchical structure throughout the pipeline:

```python
{
    "equipment_type": {  # e.g., "AHU"
        "instance_id": {  # e.g., "AHU-1"
            [point1, point2, ...]  # Points belonging to this instance
        }
    }
}
```

This structure preserves the semantic relationships between points and enables efficient processing.

## 4. Implementation Approach

### 4.1 Memory Management

The system implements memory-efficient processing through:

1. **Batch Processing**:
   - Process large datasets in manageable chunks
   - Configurable batch size (default 500 points)
   - Progress tracking and reporting

2. **Memory Monitoring**:
   - Real-time memory usage tracking
   - Configurable memory limits
   - Automatic adjustment of batch size based on memory usage

3. **Garbage Collection**:
   - Explicit garbage collection between batches
   - Release of intermediate results after processing

### 4.2 Error Handling Strategy

The system implements a comprehensive error handling strategy:

1. **Exception Hierarchy**:
   - ValidationError: For invalid input data
   - ProcessingError: For failures during processing
   - ResourceError: For missing resources (ontology, etc.)
   - MemoryError: For memory-related issues

2. **Error Context**:
   - Rich context information with exceptions
   - Batch and point identification for debugging
   - Phase information for error isolation

3. **Error Collection Mode**:
   - Option to collect errors without aborting
   - Continues processing despite non-critical errors
   - Comprehensive error summary

### 4.3 Logging and Diagnostics

The system includes extensive logging and diagnostics:

1. **DiagnosticLogger**:
   - Captures processing metrics
   - Logs processing time per phase
   - Records memory usage

2. **Structured Logging**:
   - Phase-specific logging
   - Hierarchical log structure
   - Performance metrics and counters

3. **Audit Trail**:
   - Records all decisions made during processing
   - Preserves reasoning for mappings
   - Enables transparency and analysis

## 5. Performance Considerations

### 5.1 Optimization Techniques

1. **Indexing and Caching**:
   - Pre-indexing of ontology data
   - Caching of frequent lookups
   - Optimization of pattern matching

2. **Parallel Processing**:
   - Potential for parallel batch processing
   - Thread pool for independent operations
   - Asynchronous I/O for resource loading

3. **Lazy Evaluation**:
   - Deferred computation of expensive operations
   - On-demand resource loading
   - Incremental result generation

### 5.2 Scalability Design

The system is designed to scale with:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - Stateless agent design
   - Support for distributed processing
   - Shared-nothing architecture

2. **Vertical Scaling**:
